# Pi-hole Blocklists Documentation

## Overview

Blocklists are curated lists of domains that Pi-hole will block at the DNS level. This provides network-wide ad blocking and threat protection.

**Related**: See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for instructions on how to add blocklists to your Pi-hole installation.

## Available Lists

### Blocklists in This Repository

- **`block-list.txt`** - Custom domains to block
- **`allow-list.txt`** - Domains to whitelist (prevent blocking)

See [lists/README.md](../lists/README.md) for current contents.

## Best Practices

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with proven lists**
   - StevenBlack/hosts is a solid foundation
   - Firebog's curated lists are well-maintained

2. **Add custom lists gradually**
   - Monitor your network for false positives
   - Adjust as needed

3. **Maintain an allowlist**
   - As you find legitimately blocked sites
   - Add them to `lists/allow-list.txt`

4. **Monitor performance**
   - Keep list count reasonable
   - Too many lists can impact performance
   - Watch DNS query response times

### Performance Considerations

- **Number of Lists**: Most setups use 5-15 lists effectively
- **List Size**: Larger lists take more memory and CPU
- **Refresh Frequency**: Adjust based on your needs
- **Cache Settings**: Enable DNS caching for speed

## Blocklist Maintenance

### Regular Updates

Enable automatic list updates in Pi-hole:
- **Settings** → **Adlists**
- Most lists update daily or weekly

### Monitoring

Use the admin dashboard to:
- View blocked queries
- Track which lists are blocking domains
- Identify false positives

### Custom Adjustments

1. **Whitelist (Allow-list)**
   - Add to `lists/allow-list.txt` in this repository
   - Or use Pi-hole's Whitelist feature

2. **Blacklist (Block-list)**
   - Add to `lists/block-list.txt` in this repository
   - Or use Pi-hole's Adlists feature

## Adding Lists to Pi-hole

### Step-by-Step

1. Open Pi-hole Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Gravity** → **Adlists**
3. Paste the blocklist URL
4. Click **Add**
5. Click **Update Gravity**

### Bulk Import

For multiple lists, you can:
1. Copy list URLs
2. Add them one by one through the dashboard
3. Or import via configuration file

## Troubleshooting

### Lists Not Updating

- Check internet connectivity
- Verify blocklist URLs are valid
- Check Pi-hole logs for errors

### Too Many False Positives

- Reduce number of active lists
- Review which lists are overly aggressive
- Add frequently-needed sites to allowlist

### Performance Degradation

- Reduce number of lists
- Increase DNS cache TTL
- Monitor system resources
